# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Rock Paper Scissors rules?
The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player. ... Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.

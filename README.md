Game must have:
Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)
Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer
Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns
A win state - a way for the player to win the game
High score can be considered a win state
A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game
Example: Blackjack - a player must be able to lose all of their money with losing hands and cannot play if their bankroll is at 0
Example: Connect Four - the other player has won or there are no possible plays left

A way to keep playing if the game is not over.

Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost
Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll
Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case
